# Classification Model Comparison
This project evaluates a range of machine learning models for a classification task. We started with logistic regression as a baseline due to its simplicity and speed. As expected, it ran quickly but only achieved average performance. Notably, adjusting its hyperparameters had minimal impact on both validation accuracy and Kaggle score â€” a pattern discussed further in our report.

We then explored several other models to compare performance:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model was assessed based on validation accuracy and average runtime.
